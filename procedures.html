        </header>

        <section class="info-content">
            <p>Before beginning the refueling process, following proper procedures helps ensure safety and reduces the risk of accidents. Here’s a step-by-step guide for preparing to refuel light aircraft, such as Cessnas and helicopters, as well as larger aircraft.</p>

            <h2>1. Review Safety Precautions</h2>
            <p>Make sure all team members understand and follow safety protocols. Ensure all necessary protective equipment, like gloves and fire extinguishers, are available and within reach.</p>

            <h2>2. Check Fuel Type and Quantity</h2>
            <p>Verify the correct type of fuel required for the specific aircraft. For example, most turbine engines require Jet A or Jet A-1 fuel, while piston engines typically use Avgas. Confirm the required fuel quantity to avoid overfilling or underfilling. Always check with the flight plan and the pilot.</p>

            <h2>3. Inspect Refueling Equipment</h2>
            <p>Visually inspect the refueling hose, nozzle, and connectors for any signs of wear or damage. Check that the fuel pump and Deadman’s control (if applicable) are functioning properly.</p>

            <h2>4. Grounding and Bonding</h2>
            <p><strong>Grounding:</strong> Connect the aircraft to the ground using grounding cables. This helps dissipate static electricity, which could ignite fuel vapors.</p>
            <p><strong>Bonding:</strong> Bond the refueling equipment (e.g., hose and nozzle) to the aircraft’s fuel port to equalize static potential between the fuel truck or pump and the aircraft. This further prevents static discharge.</p>

            <h2>5. Inspect the Fuel Tank Cap and Fuel Ports</h2>
            <p>Ensure that the fuel tank cap and fuel ports are clean and free from dirt or debris. Check that the caps and seals are in good condition to prevent leaks.</p>

            <h2>6. Check Weather Conditions</h2>
            <p>Avoid refueling during thunderstorms or if lightning is present, as this can increase the risk of static discharge. If operating outside, be aware of wind direction to prevent fuel vapors from accumulating around the fueling area.</p>

            <h2>7. Ensure Communication is Established</h2>
            <p>Establish a clear line of communication between ground crew and the pilot. Use radio communication or hand signals to coordinate the fueling process. Confirm that everyone involved understands their role and knows the procedure for emergency situations.</p>

            <h2>8. Ensure Fire Safety Measures are in Place</h2>
            <p>Position a fire extinguisher nearby and ensure all ground crew know its location and operation. Prohibit smoking, open flames, and the use of mobile phones near the refueling area, as these can create ignition sources.</p>

            <h2>9. Position the Refueling Equipment Properly</h2>
            <p>Position the refueling truck or portable fueling system so that the hose can reach the fuel ports without being stretched or bent. Ensure the fueling nozzle is clean and ready for use.</p>

            <h2>10. Perform a Final Visual Inspection</h2>
            <p>Double-check all grounding and bonding connections. Verify that the correct fuel nozzle is connected to the fuel port, and that there are no visible leaks.</p>

            <p>Once all these steps are complete, the refueling process can begin with confidence that all safety measures are in place. Proper preparation before refueling not only ensures the safety of the crew and aircraft but also helps avoid delays and operational issues.</p>
